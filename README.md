Find me on github

This code creates a simple web application that lets users input a GitHub username. When the user clicks a "search" button , the JavaScript code fetches data from the GitHub API related to the entered username. It then generates an HTML card displaying information about the GitHub user, including their avatar, login name, location, and HTML URL. This card is dynamically added to a section of the webpage with the id "cards." It allows users to search for GitHub users and displays their information on the page as cards.
